# Data Wrangler

Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler reduces the time it takes to aggregate and prepare data for machine learning (ML) from weeks to minutes. With SageMaker Data Wrangler, you can simplify the process of data preparation and feature engineering, and complete each step of the data preparation workflow, including data selection, cleansing, exploration, and visualization from a single visual interface. Using SageMaker Data Wrangler’s data selection tool, you can choose the data you want from various data sources and import it with a single click. SageMaker Data Wrangler contains over 300 built-in data transformations so you can quickly normalize, transform, and combine features without having to write any code. With SageMaker Data Wrangler’s visualization templates, you can quickly preview and inspect that these transformations are completed as you intended by viewing them in Amazon SageMaker Studio, the first fully integrated development environment (IDE) for ML. Once your data is prepared, you can build fully automated ML workflows with Amazon SageMaker Pipelines and save them for reuse in the Amazon SageMaker Feature Store
